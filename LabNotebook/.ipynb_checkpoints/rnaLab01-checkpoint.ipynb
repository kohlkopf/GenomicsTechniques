    "1. ***Extraction protocol:***\n",
    "    1. ***How does a TRIzol extraction work?***  \n",
    "        TRIzol is a solution of phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate that solubilizes biological material and denatures protein simultaneously. After solubilization, the addition of chloroform causes phase separation. Protein is extracted to the organic phase, DNA resolves at the interface, and RNA remains in the aqueous phase\n",
    "    2. ***Is there DNA present in your sample at the end? How could you get rid of the DNA?***\n",
    "        A small amount of DNA was present. I could treat the mixed RNA/DNA with a DNase treatment.\n",
    "2. ***Alcohol precipiation:***  \n",
    "    1. ***Why did you wash your RNA pellet during your alcohol precipitation?***  \n",
    "        To rinse any lingering supernatant and to remove salt and polysaccharids.\n",
    "    1. ***What is the purpose of the salt for the alcohol precipiatation?***  \n",
    "        We did not add salt during this step. It is optional. The salt forces the precipitation of nucleic acids out of solution. The salt neutralizes the charges on the sugar phosphate backbone. A commonly used salt is sodium acetate. In solution, sodium acetate breaks up into Na+ and [CH3COO]-. The positively charged sodium ions neutralize the negative charge on the PO3- groups on the nucleic acids, making the molecule far less hydrophilic, and therefore much less soluble in water.\n",
    "    1. ***List 3 ways to increase the yield during an RNA alcohol precipitation when precipitating very small quantities of RNA.***  \n",
    "        --Ensure good shearing of the genomic DNA and release of RNA from all cells  \n",
    "        --Perform the phase seperation step again  \n",
    "        --Use a greater volume of TRIzol\n",
    "3. ***RNA Quantitation***\n",
    "    1. ***Which of these methods give the best estimate of RNA quality?***\n",
    "        The absorbance test performed on the nanodrop gave the best estimate of RNA quality\n",
    "    1. ***Which of these methods give the best estimate of concentration?***\n",
    "        The Qubit gave the best estimate of concentration.\n",
    "4. ***What is the difference between using absorbance at 260nm and the Qubit?***\n",
    "    The Nanodrop measures the amount of photons absorbed after it passes through a solution. It is sensitive to every molecule in the solution. With the Qubit, fluorescent agents are attached to the RNA. The device measures quantifies the concentration based on the intensity of these fluorescent agents.\n",
    "5. ***Why would you run a denaturing gel electrophorseis instead of a native?***\n",
    "    A denaturing gel allows for more accurate size comparison as after denaturing, we are left with mostly linear molecules. \n",
    "6. ***How can a spectrophotometer be used to obtain your [RNA]?***\n",
    "    Concentration a absorbance have a linear realtionship. The concentration can be be determined utilizing the Lambert-Beer law.\n",
    "7. ***Does your RNA fit the description of \"high quality\" RNA? Why or why not?***\n",
